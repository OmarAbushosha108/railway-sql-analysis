# Railway Data Analysis using SQL

This project is a case study focused on analyzing railway operational data using SQL. The goal is to explore, clean, and extract meaningful insights from real-world transportation datasets.

---

## Dataset Overview

The analysis is based on two CSV files:

- **railway.csv** – Contains the core railway dataset with operational records.  
- **railway_data_dictionary.csv** – Provides descriptions for each field in the main dataset.

---

## Objective

The main objectives were to:

- Analyze train schedules and performance  
- Identify delays and punctuality trends  
- Extract meaningful KPIs (Key Performance Indicators) to support decision-making

---

## SQL Analysis

The analysis was performed using SQL queries, focusing on:

- Identifying trains with the highest delays  
- Comparing scheduled vs. actual arrival times  
- Aggregating passenger counts and train frequencies  
- Highlighting operational bottlenecks  

---

## Results & Insights

- Several trains demonstrated consistent delays during peak hours  
- Certain routes exhibited high deviation between scheduled and actual arrival times  
- Data inconsistencies were detected, requiring data cleaning steps before analysis  

---

## How to Use

1. Download the dataset files and SQL script from this repository  
2. Open the provided `.sql` file in any SQL client (e.g., SQLite, DBeaver)  
3. Import `railway.csv` as a database table  
4. Run the queries in the provided SQL script  
5. Review the output tables or generate reports  

---

## Files Included

- `railway.csv` – Main dataset  
- `railway_data_dictionary.csv` – Column descriptions  
- `queries.sql` – SQL queries used in the analysis  
- `outputs/` – Contains query result snapshots (optional)  
- `screenshots/` – Visualization of selected SQL query outputs
